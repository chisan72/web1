<P><strong><a href="https://100.daum.net/encyclopedia/view/216XXXH003674">intervertebral disc</a></strong> (or intervertebral fibrocartilage) lies between
adjacent vertebrae in the vertebral column. Each disc forms a
fibrocartilaginous joint (a symphysis), to allow slight movement
of the vertebrae, to act as a ligament to hold the vertebrae together,
 and to function as a shock absorber for the spine.</P>
 <img src="disc.jpg"width="100%"><p>There is one disc between each pair of vertebrae, except for the first cervical segment,
the atlas. The atlas is a ring around the roughly cone-shaped extension of
the axis (second cervical segment). The axis acts as a post around which
the atlas can rotate, allowing the neck to swivel. There are 23 discs
 in the human spine: 6 in the neck (cervical) region, 12 in the middle back
  (thoracic) region, and 5 in the lower back (lumbar) region[3]
<br><br>  Discs are named by the vertebral body above and below. For example,
   the disc between the fifth and sixth cervical vertebrae is designated
    "C5-6".[4]</p>
